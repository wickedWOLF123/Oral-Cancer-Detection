# Oral-Cancer-Detection

Overview
This project is focused on detecting oral cancers through medical image analysis using deep learning techniques. By leveraging computer vision (CV) models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the goal is to automate the detection process for early diagnosis.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Applied filters, masks, and various image augmentation techniques to enhance the quality of input medical images.
Model Development: Built and trained CNN and RNN models using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch to improve classification accuracy.
Experimentation: Tested different deep learning architectures and techniques, comparing the performance of multiple models to find the most effective approach for detecting oral cancers.
Research-Based Approach: Referred to and recreated several research papers to improve detection algorithms and stay updated with the latest advancements in medical computer vision.
