# Oral Cancer Detection using Deep Learning


This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting oral cancer through medical image analysis. By leveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the objective is to assist in early diagnosis, potentially improving patient outcomes through timely intervention.


# Overview
Detecting oral cancer at an early stage can significantly increase the chances of successful treatment. This project employs computer vision techniques to analyze medical images and detect potential cases of oral cancer. Through a combination of CNN and RNN architectures, we aim to create a robust model capable of high accuracy in cancer detection.

# Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Applied filters, masks, and various image augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, scaling) to enhance the quality of medical images and improve model robustness.
- Model Development: Implemented CNNs and RNNs using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch to classify medical images for cancer detection.
- Model Experimentation: Compared multiple architectures and techniques, including CNN, RNN, and hybrid models, to identify the most effective model for cancer detection.
